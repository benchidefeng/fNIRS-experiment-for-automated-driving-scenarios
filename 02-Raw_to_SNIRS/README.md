## fNIRS experiment for driving risk cognition 

This is an  fNIRS experiment written for collecting fNIRS dataset for driving risk cognition of passengers in highly
automated driving scenarios

## Description

Kinetic energy field is a class of risk field. It indicates a danger degree of driving scenario, and involves relative longitudinal distance and the speed of target vehicle (or pedestrian). In this experiment, the value 0.05 of Kinetic energy field is used as a stimulus point, and the fNIRS data of each scenario was divided into low-risk and high-risk episodes according to this stimulus point.

## Instructions to participant

Each participant need to finish 12 tasks. For each task, participants need to sit in a driving simulator and focus on watching the front each virtual test drive (VTD) segment. Participants act as a passenger and not directly operate the vehicles. Participant was asked to have a rest about 5 minutes at the end of task, and during one day, participants only took part in four tasks. On sensing danger or hearing a stimulating sound, he/she was  only required to press the keyboard.

## Related tools and information
In this experiment, fourteen types of highly automated driving scenarios are built based on VTD software. Those twelve VTD segments can be rebuilt based on VTD software and a project file. We provide this project file and one visual video of those driving scenarios, and they are  "fNIRSProject" and "ScenarioVideo.mp4‚Äù ,respectively. The order of those fourteen kind scenarios are lead vehicle cuts out to right lane, lead vehicle cuts out to left lane,lead vehicle autonomously emergency brakes in a long distance, surrounding vehicle cuts in from the left lane in a short distance, surrounding vehicle cuts in from the right lane in a short distance, surrounding vehicle cuts in from the right lane in a long distance, lead vehicle autonomously emergency brakes in a short distance, surrounding vehicle cuts in from the left lane in a long distance, surrounding vehicles runs on the right land and do not cut in, pedestrian crosses the road from right, pedestrian crosses the road from left, pedestrian stands on the left side without crossing the road,
pedestrian stands on the right side without crossing the road, surrounding vehicle runs on left land and does not cut in.
