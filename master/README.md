## The supplementaries for An fNIRS dataset in highly automated driving scenarios

This repository will provide some supplementaries for An fNIRS dataset for driving risk cognition of passengers in highly automated driving scenarios

## **Abstact** 

With the tremendous technology iteration for highly automated driving vehicles, it makes the brain-computer interface system in automated vehicles highly depend on the brain state of passengers rather than that of human drivers. How to implement the mental activities of the most advanced senor-human being into safe driving is a meaningful and vital choice in the future. Quantifying the cognition of the driving risk of the passenger is a basic step. Herein, an fNIRS dataset focusing on the prefrontal cortex activity in fourteen types of highly automated driving scenarios, which considers age, sex and driving experience factors, was created in this paper, among which the data was divided into low-risk and high-risk episodes according to a risk field. This dataset contains the data of an 8-channel fNIRS device and driving scenarios. The dataset provides the data support for distinguishing the driving risk of passengers in highly automated driving scenarios by brain-computer interface systems, and it also brings a possibility to prevent potential hazard for some scenarios, in which risk remain at high value for an extended period, before hazard occurs.

## How to use this repository

I have used branches in this repository to describe those supplementaries. Using the GitHub interface you can select the branch you wish to view. The branches are...

- 01-experiment: Contains a project file and one visual video of those driving scenarios,  This project file can rebuilt Those twelve VTD segments based on VTD software
- 02-Raw_to_SNIRS: Converts the original data to snirf, but not BIDS.
- master: Contains  one example about data preprocessing using Homer3, and  codes mentioned in the paper of An fNIRS dataset for driving risk cognition of passengers in highly automated driving scenarios.
